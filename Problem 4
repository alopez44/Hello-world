#i put the letter I for integers.

for I in range(51):
#so any number that corresponds with 3 or 5 is divisible by both.
    if I % 3 == 0 and I % 5 == 0:
        print("divisible by both")
#if number can only be added up by threes, its divisible by 3.
    elif I % 3 == 0:
        print("divisible by three")
#if the number can only be added by fives, its divisible by 5.
    elif I % 5 == 0:
        print("divisble by five")
    print(I)
